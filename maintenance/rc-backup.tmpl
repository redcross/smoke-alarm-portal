# Here's one way to do backups on the production server:
#
# Create a user named 'rcbackup', who has no password, whose shell
# is set to /bin/bash, and whose home directory is readable only by
# that user & group.
#
# Add this user as a Postgres role and give it read access to the smoke
# alarm database:
#
#   CREATE USER rcbackup PASSWORD '<password>';
#   GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <db_name> TO rcbackup;
#   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO rcbackup;
#   GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO rcbackup;
#   GRANT SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO rcbackup;
#
# Then edit this script with your destination directory and DB username
# and password.
#
# Now you have an 'rc-backup' script that you can run as in a cron job
# as user 'rcbackup', assuming you set up permissions appropriately.
# For example, you could put this in /etc/crontab
#
#   30 3 * * * rcbackup /usr/local/bin/rc-backup
#
# ...to have the script run at 3:30am every morning and put the backup
# in /home/rcbackup/backups/DATE/.  (Of course, you might want to have
# another cron job that then copies the backup to a remote location.)
